This project is about management of clubs in our college. We wanted to have a single website for all the clubs which includes all the member details, club head, events and event registration. There are two login access provided in which a user can login and participate in club events and club president can add users, create events with posters, create vacancy for members. Our main goal was to centralised the distributed system of all the clubs in our college.
